# C--Roman-Numeral-Converter
This program allows the user to enter a Roman Numeral and convert it to a decimal or enter a decimal and convert it to a Roman Numeral.

This project was our first and had to be completed in 1 week. We were told not to use classes or debugging. Normally I would break these functions off into classes and check the values entered to ensure they were the correct type and format.
